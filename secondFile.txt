You get a shiver in the dark
It's a raining in the park but meantime-
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double four time
You feel alright when you hear the music ring
Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
# LINE 1 CHANGED IN BRANCH git_1  Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound
# LINE 1 CHANGED IN BRANCH git_1  Way on down south
